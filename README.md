# About the project
The picoProcessor (pP) is an 8-bit processor intended for educational purposes. It is similar to 8-bit microprocessors
for small embedded applications, but has an instruction set architecture more similar to RISC processors. The pP has separate instruction and data memories. The instruction memory is 4K instructions in size, and the data memory is 256 bytes. The pP can also address I/O devices using up to 256 input ports and 256 output ports. Within the processor there are eight 8-bit general purposes registers, r0 to r7. R0 is always read as zero and ignores writes. There is also a return-address stack of implementation-defined depth (at least four entries), an interrupt return register and Zero (Z) and Carry (C) condition codes. In this project we will design this processor and the design include the following steps:
-	RTL description 
-	Datapath components
-	List of all control signals 
-	The Datapath with all necessary multiplexors and all control lines identified 
-	The design of control unit
